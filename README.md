# Malaria Detection Dataset

The dataset comprises two folders:

- **Infected**
- **Uninfected**

With a total of 27,558 images.

## Acknowledgements

This dataset is sourced from the official NIH Website: [NIH Malaria Datasets](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/). We have uploaded it here to facilitate quicker access for anyone looking to work with the dataset, as downloading directly from the NIH website can be time-consuming.

## Inspiration

The goal is to save lives by developing models that can detect and classify cells as infected or uninfected with malaria. Check out the dataset on Kaggle: [Cell Images for Detecting Malaria](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria). Our objective is to classify patients as either affected or not.

Let's collaborate to build tools that contribute to the early detection and diagnosis of malaria. 🌐💉🔬 #MalariaDetection #MedicalImaging #DataScience #Kaggle
